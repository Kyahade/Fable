        <dd>On a warm late summer’s day, a fox roamed the countryside. His reddish-brown fur shone in the sun and a light breeze blew through the surrounding bushes.

            The birds in the trees were chirping and everything seemed peaceful and calm. The fox let his gaze wander in search of something to eat.
            
            He hadn’t eaten anything all day and his stomach was grumbling. 
            
            “I need something to eat or else I’ll starve to death!” he thought.
            
            Just then, he caught sight of a magnificent vine growing on the roof of the old farmhouse. Hanging from it were countless bunches of grapes, glistening in the sun. 
            
            “That’s just the thing!” he thought, and he ran towards the farm. 
            
            From below the vine, he could see little tits and blackbirds snacking on one bunch after another. They were clearly delicious grapes, as the birds couldn’t get enough of them.
            
            “This will be easy for me,” thought the fox and he took a few steps back. He crouched down and jumped up to grab the grapes with his paw. 
            
            But he missed and landed on the ground with an empty paw. 
            
            “I must have taken too little of a run-up. Two more steps and I’ll have the whole vine in my paws,” he thought confidently.
            
            But on his next attempt, his paws again reached into the void and he landed on the ground without any grapes. The fox tried over and over, but each of his attempts to pluck a few grapes from the vine failed. 
            
            Half an hour and countless jumps later, the fox was exhausted. Full of anger and defiance, he snorted, “Pah! I would really try if these grapes were at least ripe and sweet. But these sour grapes aren’t worth my effort!”
            
            The tits and blackbirds were unperturbed by his activities and nibbled one grape after another. With empty paws and a grumbling stomach, the proud fox turned away and continued to roam the countryside. </dd><br>
